## Introduction :
Never try Python, never try an API, want to try e-ink screen so let's go !
But what can I do to start, let's go DuckDuckGo with the words "Free API" and Transport API, well great, live data, large amount of data and I know a friend living in UK who's always late so this project can help (well, was late because now, remote working) and have an 3D printer so I can make a surprise so... Let's go for a proto !


## Finally :

PICS
Use of an API :
- Thought it was more complex than that but too soon to said, I should comparate with another

Impression on Python : 
- not a big fan of indentation, not very readable
- Easy to import packages

Oh and friends leaving UK... But I'll still continue and finish this project

## Next part :
Found information for rendering on e-ink
Finally, decide to buy an e-ink screen and if i'm using a Raspberry Pi Zero (pro: can still use Python, cheap. cons : too powerful for the project) or an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 (pro: seems perfect for a project of this dimension. cons : expensive, need to use a driver shield, change to C/C++)
